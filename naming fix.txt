The current version of PyTube carries an error, in which all titles are named "youtube".
If this bothers you, please follow these instructions

Edit the __main__.py located in your venv directory, For Windows, 
it's usually at C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Lib\site-packages\pytube
(note: replace YOURUSERNAME with your own username)

Go to line 116 or Find and Replace:
i_start = self.watch_html.lower().index("<title>") + len("<title>")
with
i_start = self.watch_html.lower().index("<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"") + len("<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"")

Save the file (ctrl+s), then run the main.py file again :D
